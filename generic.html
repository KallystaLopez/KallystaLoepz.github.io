							<h1 class="major">Dear Ms. Joshi</h1>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Ms. Joshi,</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Naomi, and I hope you are doing well in these times. I am writing to you because I saw your ad online for &ldquo;Karma Consultations&rdquo; (your graphic designer killed it by the way). I&rsquo;ve actually been meaning to contact you sooner, but since the whole world fell under lockdown it slipped my mind. I&rsquo;ve heard about you before from my friend Kari. You might remember her, long red hair, smells like peaches all the time. Anyway, she said you helped her greatly with the whole Mark situation (I tried to warn her about him before, I really did) and that you would be able to help me too. I don&rsquo;t know what you did, or how you did it, but the justice we felt seeing him fired and dumped by the girl he cheated with was so worth the wait. I have my own Mark story, but with a gut wrenching twist at the end. Well, it was gut wrenching to me, can&rsquo;t say the same thing about how others feel.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My story goes like this. It all starts when I had the misfortune of meeting Jordan freshman year of college. Trust me, if I could go back in time, I&rsquo;d go as far back to when I was just starting out sports and tell my younger self to pick anything other than tennis. Back to the present, so he was on the men&rsquo;s team and I the women&rsquo;s. Nothing happened in the beginning, I treated him just like any other teammate, polite, friendly. The men would often have their practice before ours, so it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for them to loiter around and stretch afterwards. However, Jordan was sticking around longer, even though the other guys had left long before. He didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong per say, but for the longest time he would just sit there on the bench, watching us practice. I&rsquo;d ask my teammates why he was just sitting there.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s just really sore and needs more time to rest,&rdquo; offered Vanessa.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;He could be ditching class,&rdquo; Harmony proposed.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What if he&rsquo;s judging my backhand?&rdquo; Xochitl would say.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While these were all good guesses, none of them stick right with me. He had to be watching for a reason, and I had to get to the bottom of it, else the mystery drive me insane. I never did end up confronting him about it, Xochitl did all the work for me. Apparently they found each other on a dating app and thought it would be funny to match with each other. Ever since then he became closer to the women&rsquo;s team. He&rsquo;d eat with us, study with us, and run errands with us&nbsp; very often.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next part of the story gets pretty cringe, so fair warning. I only have my womanly heart to blame. So it turns out, the more I spent time with Jordan, the more my stomach would flip and flutter and do all kinds of movement a stomach shouldn&rsquo;t naturally do. Look, it&rsquo;s not my fault that he had big, blue eyes, a jawline, and floofy blonde hair. Anyway, I found myself around him often, and I would change my plans if it meant that I would get to see him. I didn&rsquo;t want to admit it back then, (I still don&rsquo;t want to now) but I was falling for the guy. He had a natural way of making me laugh, and talking to him was easy. I felt comfortable around him, and he was willing to listen to anything I had to say. I felt validated and appreciated, things I don&rsquo;t often get.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We really hit it off when tennis season started in the spring. We would cheer and support each other, always making sure we gave our fistbump to each other after a match. It went on like this for a month before he admitted to liking me. I was on cloud nine. My crush confessed and all was well in the world. Until it wasn&rsquo;t. Two months went by and things between us stayed relatively the same (with a few kisses and cuddle sessions here and there). He wouldn&rsquo;t call me his girlfriend out in public, or private. In fact, he never actually asked me out, so technically we never dated.&nbsp; I would bring this up to him, but he always dodged the question.&nbsp;</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One day, he told me he didn&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. I was heartbroken and left wondering what I did wrong. I was closest on the team with Xochitl, so I told her everything I felt. Fast forward a few weeks, Xochitl and Jordan announce their relationship. Words cannot even begin to describe what I felt, but here&rsquo;s a list of the closest words I could come up with:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrespected</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rage</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replaced</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurt</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devastated</span></li>
							</ul>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The real kicker is that they somehow got everyone on the team to hate me, even though I was the one being wronged. This situation affected me so much that seeing them physically hurt me. It affected my sport so badly that I decided it was better if I quit. They ruined my love for tennis. They ruined my confidence. They ruined my trust. They ruined my view on love. They ruined me.&nbsp;</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ms. Joshi, I ask you to help me. Help me so that karma can do it&rsquo;s meticulous work. I don&rsquo;t mind if it&rsquo;s slow, I actually prefer it that way. This way they really think that they deserve everything they&rsquo;ve worked for, then karma hits and they realize the horrible mistake they&rsquo;ve made. Like I said before, I don&rsquo;t know how you do it, or if you even do anything at all. Maybe these emails that get sent to you are purely cathartic, I know I feel a lot better getting this off my chest. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a good day.</span></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naomi Noriaki</span></p>
